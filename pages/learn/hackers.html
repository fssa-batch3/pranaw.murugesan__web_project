            <h2>White Hat</h2>        
            <p>A white hat hacker -- or ethical hacker -- is an individual who uses hacking skills to identify security vulnerabilities in hardware, software or networks. However, unlike black hat hackers -- or malicious hackers -- white hat hackers respect the rule of law as it applies to hacking. Many white hat hackers are former black hat hackers. The terms come from old Western movies, where heroes often wore white hats and the bad guys wore black hats. White hat hackers only seek vulnerabilities or exploits when they are legally permitted to do so. White hat hackers may do their research on open source software, as well as on software or systems they own or have been authorized to investigate, including products and services that operate bug bounty programs.</p></div>

<div class="grayhat">
    <h2>Gray Hat</h2>
    <p>Somewhere between white and black are gray hat hackers. Gray hat hackers enact a blend of both black hat and white hat activities. Gray hat hackers often look for vulnerabilities in a system without the owner's permission or knowledge. If issues are found, they report them to the owner, sometimes requesting a small fee to fix the problem. Some gray hat hackers like to believe they are doing something good for companies by hacking their websites and invading their networks without permission. Still, company owners rarely appreciate unauthorized forays into their business information infrastructure. Often, a gray hat's real intention is to show off their skills and gain publicity — maybe even appreciation — for what they consider a contribution to cybersecurity.</p>
</div>

<div class="blackhat">
    <h2>Black Hat</h2>
    <p>Black hat hackers often develop specialties, such as phishing or managing remote access tools. Many get their "jobs" through forums and other connections on the dark web. Some develop and sell malicious software themselves, but others prefer to work through franchises or leasing arrangements – again, similar to the legitimate business world.Hacking has become an integral intelligence-gathering tool for governments, but it is more common for black hat hackers to work alone or with organized crime organizations for easy money.</p>

    <h1>Who is a hacker</h1>
    <p>A hacker is ideally a person who is skilled in information technology. He uses his technical knowledge to overcome an obstacle or sometimes even achieve a goal within a computerized system. However, in recent times, the term hacker is always associated with a security hacker – someone who is always on the lookout for ways to acquire and exploit sensitive personal, financial and organizational information, which is otherwise not accessible to them. Legitimate figures often use hacking for legal purposes. 
    </p>
    <h1>How does Hacking Work?</h1>
    <p>Hackers are highly skilled in breaching securities to gain unauthorized access to phones, tablets, computers, IoT devices, networks, or the networking system of an entire organization. They are generally very proficient in exploiting weaknesses in network security, taking advantage of the same. These weaknesses can be technical or social in nature. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Technical weaknesses: Hackers are extremely talented in exploiting software vulnerabilities or weak security practices. They do this to gain unauthorized access or even sometimes to inject malware that would crumple the entire system.</li>
        <li>Social weaknesses: This kind of social engineering is done to convince those with privileged access to click on malicious links, open infected files, or reveal personal information. This allows them access to otherwise hardened infrastructures.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Computers and the Internet have changed the work environment of the world beyond imagination. Computers on taking over a major part of our lives, all our data has got transferred from records and ledgers to computers. Though this kind of shift in working has reduced the physical burden on workers it has also increased the chances of data theft. People involved in stealing data or harming the systems are knowledgeable people with wrong intentions known as Hackers. There are different types of hackers. Let’s take a look at how many types of hackers are there and the types of hacker attacks and techniques.</p>
