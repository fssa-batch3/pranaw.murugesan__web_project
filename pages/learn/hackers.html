    <h1>Who is a hacker</h1>
    <p>A hacker is ideally a person who is skilled in information technology. He uses his technical knowledge to overcome an obstacle or sometimes even achieve a goal within a computerized system. However, in recent times, the term hacker is always associated with a security hacker – someone who is always on the lookout for ways to acquire and exploit sensitive personal, financial and organizational information, which is otherwise not accessible to them. Legitimate figures often use hacking for legal purposes. 
    </p>
    <h1>How does Hacking Work?</h1>
    <p>Hackers are highly skilled in breaching securities to gain unauthorized access to phones, tablets, computers, IoT devices, networks, or the networking system of an entire organization. They are generally very proficient in exploiting weaknesses in network security, taking advantage of the same. These weaknesses can be technical or social in nature. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Technical weaknesses: Hackers are extremely talented in exploiting software vulnerabilities or weak security practices. They do this to gain unauthorized access or even sometimes to inject malware that would crumple the entire system.</li>
        <li>Social weaknesses: This kind of social engineering is done to convince those with privileged access to click on malicious links, open infected files, or reveal personal information. This allows them access to otherwise hardened infrastructures.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Computers and the Internet have changed the work environment of the world beyond imagination. Computers on taking over a major part of our lives, all our data has got transferred from records and ledgers to computers. Though this kind of shift in working has reduced the physical burden on workers it has also increased the chances of data theft. People involved in stealing data or harming the systems are knowledgeable people with wrong intentions known as Hackers. There are different types of hackers. Let’s take a look at how many types of hackers are there and the types of hacker attacks and techniques.</p>
